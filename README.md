# temperature-controlled-box
A control system to control the temperature in a heat isolated box.
The box is meant to house a resin printer and keep it warm even though it's placed in a cold environment where its toxic fumes don't spread into the house.

The IDE used for writing this code is Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO add-on. This allows me to write C++ code and deploy it to the Arduino board with ease, and I'm even able to use the simplified Arduino functions and libraries that usually wouldn't be compatible with pure C++.

### Components needed:
1. An isolated box, in this case with a wooden frame with a double layered plexiglass front panel and flamingo inside.
2. A micro controller, such as the arduino Uno or nano.
3. A heating unit, in this case a .... with integrated fan.
4. Some sensors
